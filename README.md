# Vision Transformer (ViT) Model Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, a novel approach to image classification using a Transformer architecture. The Vision Transformer splits images into patches and applies a standard transformer model on these patches, achieving competitive performance with traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Introduction

The **Vision Transformer (ViT)** was introduced in the paper **[An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)** by Dosovitskiy et al. Instead of using convolutional layers, ViT splits images into a sequence of patches and applies a transformer, similar to how tokens are processed in natural language processing (NLP). This repository provides an implementation of the ViT model along with the training and evaluation pipeline for image classification tasks.

## Features

- Implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) model from scratch.
- Supports customizable patch sizes and transformer hyperparameters.
- Easily configurable for different datasets and image classification tasks.
- Preprocessing utilities for splitting images into patches.
- Example training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.
